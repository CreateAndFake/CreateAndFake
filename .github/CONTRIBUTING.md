3) git config --global user.signingKey [XXX]
4) git config --global tag.gpgSign true
5) git config --global commit.gpgSign true
6) git config --global push.gpgSign "if-asked"

Read more about GPG keys in the following section.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

To allow contributions to be used by the project, developers must declare that they can and do give rights to use that code. This is done by signing off on commits by appending a message at the end of the commit for all owners in the format:

```
Signed-off-by: FirstName LastName <email@mail.com>
```

This can be accomplished manually or by using -s or --signoff when committing. Github can verify this signature with your GPG key, which you can learn about [here](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-commits-with-gpg/). By signing off your commits to this repository, you're confirming that you've read DCO and agree with it, which can be found at https://developercertificate.org/ or read below:


```
Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.
